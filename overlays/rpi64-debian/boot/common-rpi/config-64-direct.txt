# Enable serial pins on GPIO for debugging.
# On 3B and later models, in the default setup, serial is handled by a
# "mini-UART" which is not very reliable.
# On earlier models it is handled by a reliable PL011 UART.
# Activating the "mini-UART" also limits the videocore clock (the mini-UART relies on it).
# Also read explanation about "dtoverlay=disable-bt" below.
# (see https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#mini-uart-and-cpu-core-frequency)

# On 3B and later models, the reliable PL011 UART exists too, but it is
# used for communication with the bluetooth chip by default.
# If bluetooth is not needed, you can uncomment the following dtoverlay line
# which will disable bluetooth but let the PL011 UART manage the serial
# communication instead of the unreliable "mini-UART".
